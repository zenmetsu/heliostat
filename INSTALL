Requirements
============

* A C++11 compliant compiler with complete support of C++11 regex (e.g., GCC 4.9 meets the minimum feature set required to build the package)
* CMake build system
* Currently the framework can be built on Linux only

Dependencies
============

* libopencv
* libindi

Build
=====

The project is using CMake as a build system. To build and install the package, execute the following commands in the root directory of the project:

	cmake .
	make
	sudo make install 

If your default compiler does not meet the minimum feature set required to build the package, you may specify alternative compiler as follows:  

	CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 cmake .
	make
	sudo make install 

In default configuration, the package will be installed with prefix `/usr`. If you want to change the prefix, you may specify it as follows:

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local .
	make
	sudo make install 

For more information see documentation available on official [CMake site](http://www.cmake.org/documentation/).
